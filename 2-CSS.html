          <p>For all the times that you rain on my parade
          And all the clubs you get in using my name
          You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
          You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
        </P><P>
          And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
          I don't but, you still hit my phone up
          And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
          I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
          My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
          And I never like to admit that I was wrong
          And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
        </P><P>
          Cause if you like the way you look that much
          Oh baby you should go and love yourself
          And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
          You should go and love yourself
        </P><P>
          But when you told me that you hated my friends
          The only problem was with you and not them
          And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
          And tried to make me forget where I came from
        </P><P>
          And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
          I don't but, you still hit my phone up
          And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
          I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
          My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
          And I never like to admit that I was wrong
          And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

          And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
          You should go and love yourself
        </P><P>
          For all the times that you've made me feel small
          I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
          Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
          Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
        </P><P>
          Cause if you like the way you look that much
          Oh baby you should go and love yourself
          And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
          You should go and love yourself
