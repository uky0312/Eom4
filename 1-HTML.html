<p>Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me reaching out for someone I can't see
take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow

It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

  And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying

  But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark? x2
